# Kidoordinate
Website that allows legal guardians residing in apartment complexes to arrange playdates for their children. Intended to foster a sense of neighborhood for children (especially from low-income families) growing up in apartment complexes, as well as help their parents develop a support network in an otherwise compartmentalized living situation. Created for HackDuke's Inequality Track. 

# Contribution
I worked on front-end, and this project was my first exposure to Bootstrap! I worked with my patient and backend-savvy friend and Comp Arch buddy Allen Qiu (http://allenqiu.com/) We are hoping to further integrate front- and back-end in the future to introduce a more card-based layout (see the html files to see what I'm talking about, or take a look at https://econsultancy.com/blog/64646-15-delicious-examples-of-card-based-web-design).
